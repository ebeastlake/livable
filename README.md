For example, if you want to live a 15-minute drive from a Trader Joe's and a 10-minute walk from a yoga studio in Seattle, I can help you with that!

I was developed with React + Redux, Leaflet.js, the Google Places API, the Google Maps Geolocation API and the Map Fruition Travel Time API.

Right now, my search results are limited to the top three results because I'm using a free API key and need to limit the number of calls that I can make. 

I hope you enjoy!
